## FAQ

### Can I use Aegis for free in my company?
Yes! Internal use, development, and testing are all free under BSL.

### Do I need a license to self-host Aegis for my company?
No. Self-hosted internal use is allowed under BSL.

### When do I need a commercial license?
Only when offering Aegis as a service to third parties (Database-as-a-Service).

### Can I modify the source code?
Yes. You can modify and create derivative works for any allowed use.

### What happens on January 26, 2030?
Version 0.1.x converts to Apache-2.0, becoming fully open source with no restrictions.

### How is this different from open source?
BSL is "source available" - you can see and modify the code, but there's one restriction: you can't offer it as a database service without a license. After the change date, it becomes true open source (Apache-2.0).
