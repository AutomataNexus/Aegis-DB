## Why BSL?

We chose BSL to:

1. **Keep source available** - You can read, audit, and learn from the code
2. **Allow broad use** - Development, testing, internal use are all free
3. **Prevent cloud exploitation** - Large providers can't offer Aegis-as-a-Service without contributing back
4. **Guarantee open source future** - Every version becomes Apache-2.0 after 4 years

This model is used by CockroachDB, Sentry, MariaDB MaxScale, and other successful projects.
